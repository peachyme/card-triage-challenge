# card-triage-challenge

In this project, I accomplished the following:

  1. Built a Triage Patient's card management system using React TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and react-beautiful-dnd for drag and drop functionality.
  2. Utilized TypeScript to enhance code readability, maintainability, and type safety throughout the project.
  3. Set up the project using Vite, providing a fast and efficient development environment.
  4. Fetched patient cards from the local server and displayed them in corresponding columns (Pending + Rejected and Done).
  5. Employed the useContext hook along with React Context API for efficient data management and persistence across components.
  6. Implemented the ability for users to change the card status from Pending or Rejected to Done and from Done to Rejected.
  7. Added local filtering functionality by patient name and arrhythmia.
  8. Used Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a clean and responsive user interface.
  9. Started implementing unit tests with Jest but could only write brief tests for the App component due to time constraints.

Tech Stack:
    React
    TypeScript
    Vite
    Tailwind CSS
    react-beautiful-dnd
    Jest (for unit testing)

Time Spent:
    I dedicated the maximum allotted time of 4 hours to this challenge, ensuring that I could showcase my skills and deliver the best possible performance within the given timeframe. Given my other commitments, such as exams, I strategically allocated approximately 1 hour per day to maintain a balanced workload.

Overall, the project showcases my ability to structure a React application, handle data management, implement drag and drop functionality, and design a user-friendly interface while adhering to time constraints.
